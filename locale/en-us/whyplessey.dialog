Plessey is just the branding i got when i was marketted in australia. plessey used to sell a lot of rebranded japanese electronic goods here. the war was not such a distant memory and there was lingering prejudice towards japanese products. plessey was british and some people found this preferable. as i may have told you, i was made in japan by a company called amano. the plessey branding does not mean much to me. does it mean anything to you?
